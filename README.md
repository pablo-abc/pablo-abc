### Welcome!

My name is Pablo Berganza, I am a software developer, mostly working as a full-stack web developer.
My main programming language is JavaScript, usually using TypeScript.

I am currently maintaining two self-made open source projects:

- [felte](https://github.com/pablo-abc/felte): A form management library for Svelte, Solid and React.
- [svelte-markdown](https://github.com/pablo-abc/svelte-markdown): A markdown renderer that renders to Svelte components.
- [uvu-expect](https://github.com/pablo-abc/uvu-expect): An assertion library with a similar syntax to ChaiJS aimed to be used with [uvu](https://github.com/lukeed/uvu).
- [uvu-expect-dom](https://github.com/pablo-abc/uvu-expect-dom): A plugin for `uvu-expect` that adds assertions for the DOM. Basically a wrapper on top of `@testing-library/jest-dom`.

Feel free to check them out!
